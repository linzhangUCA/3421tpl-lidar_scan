# LiDAR Scan

## Objetives
- Explore usage of [RPLIDAR A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/lidar/a1) with a Python [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RPLIDAR).
- Visualize LiDAR scan data.
- Polar and Cartesian coordinates transformation.

## Requirements
Place the LiDAR at designated location, scan and analyze the data.
### (60%) 1. LiDAR Scan Visualization
1. Complete at least 1 successful scan in 360 degrees with 100+ non-zero data points. 
2. Plot the data points from last successful scan under the polar coordinate system.
3. Save the plot as a PNG image file in this repository.
4. Print scan distance at 0, 235, 315 degrees and the (x, y) coordinates under the Cartesian frame as shown below.

### (40%) 2. Transform Polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates 
1. Describe the transformation rule (from polar to cartesian) using math language.
2. Attach a diagram to explain such a transformation. You can download one online, but your figure has to be correctly rendered by Github Markdown.
